# ros-astrobee

## Instructions to get started with a prebuilt astrobee sim:
 
Install docker for your OS and check with `docker version`
*(If running on a Windows 10 host, start your Docker desktop.)*

Clone this repo and `cd` into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/tammerb/ros-astrobee.git
cd ros-astrobee/
```

### Pull the Docker image
Pull the pre-built Docker image (*note: the compressed image is 1.7GB and 6GB once extracted*):
```
docker pull thbarkouki/astrobee:built
```

Check that the pull was successful with the `docker images` command.

### Running on a Linux host:
Run the simulator with
```
./run.sh
```

*Note: If you get a "Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket..." error, execute the script with `sudo`
```
sudo ./run.sh
```
A browser tab should automatically open at http://localhost:8080/vnc_auto.html. If not, manually enter this address into your browser.
See below for **Flying Astrobee** instructions. Once you're done, stop and remove both containers with `docker-compose down`.

### Running on a Windows host (tested with git for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/):
Same as above for linux but with the following script
```
./runwin.sh
```

### Flying Astrobee: TELEOP
In a new terminal from the one you launched the sim from, enter ("attach to") the docker container and source the ros commands with
```
docker attach astrobee_sim_container
source /root/freeflyer_build/native/devel/setup.bash
```
Now you should be able to "tele-operate" the astrobee using the teleop instructions available from the original Astrobee repo here:
https://github.com/nasa/astrobee/blob/972b78b6651e87a634f7ae99a3b12aea860053f1/management/executive/teleop_tool.md

#### *For testing only:* To install the sim and start the containers, but not launch the sim (this will also do the `pull` step above if not already done):
Run `install.sh`. This will start both the astrobee and noVNC containers, but will not launch the sim. You can open a second terminal and attach to the sim container by running `docker attach astrobee_sim_container`. You can then edit and launch the sim from inside. Exit the container with `exit`, and stop and remove both containers with `docker-compose down`.
